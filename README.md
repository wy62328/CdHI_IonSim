Cosmic Dawn HI Global Spectrum Experiment Simulation - For Systemic Effects Testing &amp; Foreground Subtraction

This program is used to do below works:
1. Single dish radio telescope drift scan simulation,
2. Systemic effects simulation, including ionosphere effects, antenna beam distortion, etc.
3. Foreground subtraction, so far includes three templates: Polynomial in log-space; EDGES polynomial; model-based SVD.

related results have been submitted to Apj recently.
